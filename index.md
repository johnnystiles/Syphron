# Autonomous On-Chain Science Lab

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to create a fully autonomous, on-chain science lab that democratizes access to advanced research equipment and experimental data. By leveraging robotics and blockchain technology, we provide researchers worldwide with the ability to conduct and own their experiments securely from anywhere, ensuring transparency, data ownership through encrypted NFTs, and community-driven science.

## Features

- **Robotic Lab Automation:** Access equipment like flow cytometry and mass spectrometry remotely.
- **On-Chain Experiments:** Conduct experiments via blockchain without physical sample submission.
- **Autonomous Cultures:** Maintain and manipulate cultures (e.g., *C. elegans*) through automated systems.
- **Data Ownership via NFTs:** Secure, encrypted data stored as NFTs for complete control.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration:** Payments and profit-sharing through cryptocurrency and tokens.

## How It Works

1. **Token Presale:** Raise funds to build and equip the lab.
2. **Access Equipment Remotely:** Researchers send samples or run virtual experiments.
3. **Data Storage:** Experimental data is encrypted and stored on-chain as NFTs.
4. **Profit Sharing:** Revenues are shared among token holders.
